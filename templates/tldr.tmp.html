<p>We all know there has been recent spate of password leaks recently, and we can only imagine it'll get worse over the years. Unfortunately we as consumers have no way to know if our password gets out whether it will be in a manor that makes it as difficult as possible to reverse. <a href="http://plaintextoffenders.com/about/"></A>For all we know the password that prevents someone from sending all your money to a personal bank account could be perfectly accessible by anyone.</a></p>
<p>So what can we do as technically savvy consumers? Well how about we raise the profile of properly securing passwords in databases. Well why not a certification programme? Obviously going around and inspecting companies databases is time consuming and potentially dangerous in the first place. What has worked well for W3C and the Creative Commons people however is a short form that lets people self certify their content. That way we can at least raise some awareness of the problem.</p>
